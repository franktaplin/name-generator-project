# name-generator-project
# This is a name generator project that I am working on to refine my coding skills. I eventually want to create an API that I can bring up on a phone or computer when I want to use it.
# The project is starting out as the silly name generator from NoStarch Press's Impractical Python Projects. I will slowly modify it and turn it a random name generator for the characters in Paizo's Pathfinder roleplaying gmae world.
